# Darknet TODO List

## Completed Tasks (2025-08-09)
- [x] Fixed buffer overflow vulnerabilities in sprintf calls
- [x] Fixed memory leak in utils.c read_intlist function
- [x] Added null checks for memory allocations in network.c
- [x] Fixed sprintf buffer overflows in demo.c
- [x] Fixed strncpy warnings in all example files
- [x] Ensured proper file handle cleanup
- [x] Verified compilation and basic functionality
- [x] Analyzed codebase for high cyclomatic complexity functions

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for critical functions
- [ ] Implement integer overflow checks in size calculations
- [ ] Replace rand() with thread-safe rand_r() in multithreaded code
- [ ] Add bounds checking for array access operations
- [ ] Create automated testing framework for detection accuracy

### Code Refactoring (Complexity Reduction)
- [ ] Refactor `load_thread()` in data.c - break down 13-branch if-else chain
- [ ] Modularize `save_weights_upto()` in parser.c - extract layer-specific weight saving
- [ ] Simplify `resize_network()` in network.c - create layer-specific resize functions
- [ ] Break down `parse_network_cfg()` in parser.c - separate config validation
- [ ] Extract helper functions from `parse_layer_by_type()` switch statement

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging throughout the codebase
- [ ] Add memory leak detection in debug builds
- [ ] Implement configuration validation to prevent invalid parameters
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Document all public APIs with proper comments

### Low Priority
- [ ] Refactor duplicate code in layer implementations
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large batch sizes
- [ ] Add support for additional image formats
- [ ] Implement model compression techniques
- [ ] Create Python bindings with proper error handling

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Conduct thorough security audit of remaining code
- [ ] Implement input validation for all user-provided data
- [ ] Add fuzzing tests for configuration parsing
- [ ] Review and secure all file I/O operations
- [ ] Implement secure random number generation

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Write developer guide for adding new layer types
- [ ] Document all configuration options
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add code examples for common use cases

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Profile and optimize critical paths
- [ ] Implement SIMD optimizations for CPU code
- [ ] Add multi-GPU support
- [ ] Optimize memory transfer between CPU and GPU
- [ ] Implement dynamic batching for inference

## Notes
- All critical security bugs have been addressed
- The codebase now compiles with minimal warnings
- Further testing with actual models recommended
- Consider migrating to modern C++ for better type safety
